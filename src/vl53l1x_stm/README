This folder includes source files for an implementation of ST's STSW-IMG007 VL53L1X API for the Raspberry 4 platform. Original versions of files in this folder come from the STSW-IMG007 package created and distributed by ST Microelectronics. Some of the files may have been changed to include platform-dependent elements.

Status:
   version v1.00

Purpose:
   VL53L0X API (Application Programming Interface and documentation)

Description:
   The VL53L0X API is a set of C functions controlling the VL53L0X (init, ranging,…) to enable the development of end-user applications. This API is structured in a way it can be compiled on any kind of platform through a well isolated platform layer (mainly for low level I2C access). Several code examples are provided to show how to use the API and perform ranging measurements. The VL53L0X is the latest product based on ST’s patented FlightSense™technology. This is a ground-breaking technology allowing absolute distance to be measured independent of target reflectance. Instead of estimating the distance by measuring the amount of light reflected back from the object (which is significantly influenced by color and surface), the VL53L0X precisely measures the time the light takes to travel to the nearest object and reflect back to the sensor (Time-of-Flight).

   Combining an IR emitter and a range sensor in a two-in-one ready-to-use reflowable package.
