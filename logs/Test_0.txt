										[TEST 0] initialization, move forward, backwards, left and right

After initialization the value of status register becomes 0x7c92. It seems to be the default value every time the motors aren't moving. What is more 9 MSBs and Bit 3 don't change at any time. If the values are ok this is relatively good news, as they are latches and it indicates that motors state doesn't really change while running.

------- Bit 15		SCK_MOD			high when device is in step-clock mode, constantly low as expected.
------- Bit 14		STEP_LOSS_B		low when stall is detected on the bridge A, constantly high as expected.
------- Bit 13		STEP_LOSS_A		low when stall is detected on the bridge A, constantly high as expected.
------- Bit 12		OCD				low when overcurrent detected, constantly high as expected.

------- Bit 11		TH_SD			low when thermal shutdown occurs, constantly high as expected.
------- Bit 10		TH_WRN			low when thermal warning occurs, constantly high as expected.
------- Bit 9		UVLO			low when undervoltage lockout or reset event occur, constantly low probably because power-up counts as reset event.
------- Bit 8		WRONG_CMD		high when non-existent command is sent to l6470, constantly low as expected.

------- Bit 7		NOTPERF_CMD		high when sent command couldn't be performed, constantly high so probably some of the commands sent during initialization couldn't be performed.
------- Bit 6 & 5	MOT_STATUS		changes values depending on the fact if the motor is stopped, accelerating, decelerating or moving with constant speed, low/low means stopped, low/high is acceleration, high/low is deceleration, high/high is constant speed.
------- Bit 4		DIR				indicates the current motor direction, high is forward, low is backward, seems to be constantly high when motors are stopped.

------- Bit 3		SW_EVN			high if switch turn-on event happens, constantly low.
------- Bit 2		SW_F			reports SW input status, constantly low.
------- Bit 1		BUSY			reflects busy pin status, low when constant speed, positioning or motion command is executed, high after command completion.
------- Bit 0		HiZ				high when any bridge is in high impedance, constantly low as expected.

Move forward:		Acceleration to full speed from 1451 to 1501-02.	(50-51 cycles)
					Deceleration to full stop from 1514 to 1534.		(20 cycles)

Move backwards:		Acceleration to full speed from 1606 to 1656-58.	(50-52 cycles)
					Deceleration to full stop from 1677 to 1697. 		(20 cycles)

Turn left:			Acceleration to full speed from 1823 to 1845.		(22 cycles)
					Deceleration to full stop from 1927 to 1932-33.		(5-6 cycles)

Turn right:			Acceleration to full speed from 2032 to 2053.		(21 cycles)
					Deceleration to full stop from 2139 to 2147-48.		(8-9 cycles)

Cycles were run at 100 Hz. Controllers were set to acceleration 400 step/s2 (4 step/cycle2) and deceleration 1000 step/s2 (10 step/cycle2) according to the setup() function. For forward and backward motion final speed was 400. It was achieved in ~50 cycles, 2 times faster than expected. Deceleration took ~20 cycles, also 2 times faster than expected. For turning motion the final speed was 163. THe robot accelerated in 21-22 cycles and decelerated in 6-9 cycles. The time needed for both actions was also close to two times lower than expected from setup.

TODO:
1. [SOLVED: TEST 1] Check NOTPERF_CMD flag before initialization. As it is high after initialization we know that something went wrong during setup.
2. [SOLVED: TEST 2] Check why the motors seem to accelerate and decelerate twice as fast as it is expected.
