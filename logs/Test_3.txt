																[TEST 3.0-3.2] Highest possible KVAL
KVAL parameters set the voltage that reach the coils of the motor. As the higher KVAL leads to higher torque, the motor was tested to see the highest allowed value of KVAL. The value was increased by 10 starting at the initial value of 100. At 140, after a while of balancing, both of the controllers reported thermal warning in the status register. The same happened at KVAL equal 130, although after a much longer time and only one of the controllers returned the flag.
